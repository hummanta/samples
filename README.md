# Samples for Hummanta Compilers

A collection of sample contracts that can be built using Hummanta Compilers.

## Adding New Sample

To add new sample:

1. Choose a language family. Place it in an existing or new language family directory.
2. Structure the sample. Include necessary files and follow repository conventions.
3. Update the README. Add the sample with a brief description under the correct section.
4. Test the sample. Ensure it builds and runs with Hummanta Compilers.

This ensures smooth integration and usability.
